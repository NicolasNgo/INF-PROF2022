        "For this project, you will have to work on a provided dataset and give a description of the informations given in this dataset. You will have to manipulate it and use different kind of Python data type that were presented to you during this class. You will also have to use some Python functions or some function that you implemented yourself. \n",

        "For this project **you have to** use the pandas library but you are free to use other libraries in addition to pandas. If so please indicate clearly which one you are using.\n",

        "\n",
        "For this project, you will work on a dataset about the cholera, and more specifically on the outcome of cholera cases all around the world between 1949 and 2016. The objective of the project will be to present the information that you could extract from this dataset. \n",

        "Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infrection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*. \n",
        "\n",
        "Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrohea. It affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated. Most people infected with *V. cholerae* do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. \n",
        "\n",
        "During the XIXth century, cholera spread across the world from its original reservoir in the Ganges delta. Six subsequent pandemics killed millions of people across all continents. The current (seventh) pandemic start in South Asia in 1961, reached Africa in 1971 and the Americas in 1991. Cholera is now endemic in many countries.\n",
